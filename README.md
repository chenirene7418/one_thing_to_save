# One Thing To Save

The purpose of the project is to show how humans decision are affected under extreme circumstances. In this case, the player is put into a burning house situation with 3 important things to save but only could save 1 out of the 3 things. The result of the decision the player made will be shown at the end. Just in case in the future if the player experienced this type of situation, he/she will know how to react and chose what he/she could save with the best of his/her ability.
